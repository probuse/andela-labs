# The car-oop repository
    This contains two files. The car_oop.py and its test test_car_oop.py
    
### The car_oop.py
    This contains a class Car with different attributes like:
        * name of car
        * model of car
        * type of car
        * number of wheels that a car has
        * number of doors that a car has
    Note that the above attributes may not apply to any car, they are just attributes of a car according to the test case.
    
### The test_car_oop.py
    As we had said above, this is just to test the car_oop.py file so that it does what we want.
